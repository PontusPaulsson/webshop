# Spring Boot Webshop

Webshop I did to learn more about HTML, Webpack, CSS, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, REST and Spring Boot.

The goal was to write it as a single page application.

The webshop supports adding new products under the admin interface. Each product has a subcategory that is attached to an category.
These products will be saved in the embedded H2 database and the images will be saved on the local disk.

The project is loaded with some testdata and pictures. You can find this in data.sql.
